//! The contract between the server's reward pricing and the till's.
//!
//! A reward changes what is owed, and the till must show — and collect — the
//! same figure the server records. The rule is: each reward covers whole units
//! of its line at the price the line was charged per unit (modifiers included,
//! capped at the line); the covered amount comes off the subtotal FIRST; the
//! discount is then resolved against the reduced subtotal; service charge and
//! tax follow through the shared engine.
//!
//! Pinned by `vectors/loyalty_reward_vectors.json` (moved from MadarRust
//! `loyalty::reward_vectors`; the till runs its own bill assembly over the same
//! bytes through `madar_money::vectors::LOYALTY_REWARD`). To change the maths
//! deliberately: change it here, run
//! `MADAR_REGENERATE_REWARD_VECTORS=1 cargo test -p madar-money loyalty::vectors`,
//! and release a tag.
