//! What a bill adds up to, and the only place that decides it.
//!
//! Moved from MadarRust `src/tax/engine.rs` (identical to madar-core
//! `src/tax.rs`, comments aside).
//!
//! This exists because the number was previously decided in three places that
//! disagreed. The dashboard called `tax_rate` a percentage and rendered `14%`
//! from a column the backend validated as a fraction `0..=1`, so an admin
//! typing what the label asked for got a 400 and an admin typing `0.14` saw
//! "0.14%" and corrected it back. Online orders skipped tax entirely
//! (`tax_amount: 0`, hard-coded at delivery finalize). And the till's figure
//! was recorded verbatim, so whatever it sent became the books.
//!
//! ## The rules
//!
//! * **Exclusive** — the menu price is net; tax is added at checkout.
//! * **Inclusive** — the menu price is what the customer pays and already
//!   contains the tax; the receipt breaks it out backwards. The two are
//!   consistent by construction: an exclusive bill of 5000 at 14% and an
//!   inclusive bill of 5700 at 14% are the same bill, and this returns the same
//!   `net`, `tax` and `total` for both.
//! * **Service charge** is a percentage of the same base as tax, and is itself
//!   taxable or not per policy. When it is taxable it enters the tax base;
//!   when it is not, it rides alongside untaxed.
//!
//! ## Why `Decimal` and not `f64`
//!
//! CLAUDE.md requires it for currency, and the old `(taxable as f64 * rate)`
//! was a real hazard rather than a theoretical one: `0.07` and `0.145` are not
//! representable in binary floating point, so a rate that is exactly half a
//! piastre lands on whichever side the representation error falls — and the
//! backend and the till, rounding the same bill from different code, could
//! land on different sides. That is a one-piastre mismatch, and with the
//! server now REJECTING mismatches it would be a refused sale.
//!
//! Rounding is half-away-from-zero, matching what `f64::round()` did before,
//! so historical orders re-price to the figures already in the books.
//!
//! ## One copy
//!
//! The till prices offline, so this logic runs in two places: the backend and
//! `madar/rust-core` (madar-core). It used to be two copies pinned together by
//! a hand-copied `tax_vectors.json`; it is now this one, and the vectors are
//! this crate's own tests (`tax::vectors`). A change here reaches both sides
//! only through a tag bump, together.

// ── No bill may be negative ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// THE RULE (owner, 2026-09-18), and the reason it is split in two.
//
// A DISCOUNT IS CAPPED, NEVER REFUSED. `discount_amount` above clamps a
// percentage to `[0, 1]` of its base and a fixed amount to `[0, base]`. A
// discount that overshoots is a person saying "make it free" in a clumsy way —
// it has one obvious correct reading, and refusing the sale over it would
// leave a customer standing at the counter. So it is capped, silently and
// identically on both sides of the wire.
//
// EVERY OTHER NEGATIVE IS REFUSED, NEVER CAPPED. A negative line, subtotal,
// service charge, tax, total or tender has NO correct reading: it is a stale
// build, a bad modifier price, or a forged payload. Capping it to zero would
// write a sale into the books that nobody made, and the books would balance
// against nothing. So the sale is refused — at the till before it can be
// queued, and at the server on the live route and at replay.
//
// Refusing at replay does not contradict the accept-and-flag rule
// (TILLS_CONTRACT §4.4.5). That rule answers "MAY this actor do this?" and
// says a sale whose money already moved is recorded even when the actor's
// grant was missing. This answers "IS this a sale at all?". A negative total
// is not a sale that happened, it is corrupt input, and it is refused for the
// same reason `quantity <= 0` already is. The op dead-letters on the till and
